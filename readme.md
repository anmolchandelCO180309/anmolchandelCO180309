I am a B.E CSE student and programming enthusiast. Coming with well- honed computer science skills as well as excellent communication skills.I always look ahead for the opportunities to gain knowledge and make new projects. So to increase my knowledge of coding, I keep grabbing those opportunities and learn day by day. Till date, I have made projects in C, C++, web languages and python but I still want to work on these languages to make bigger and better projects. My aim is to secure a responsible position in an organization where I can enhance my skills and look forward to an extensive, progressive and dynamic career to learn, grow and excel as a professional.
