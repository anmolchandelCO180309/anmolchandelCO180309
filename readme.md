I'm a student of Btech Computer science in Punjab University. My aim is to build a constructive career in the field of computer science by obtaining opportunity to pursue my career in corporate world, also contribute my bit to the society as well as to hold a responsible challenging and awarding position in a software development organization. I always look ahead for the opportunities to gain knowledge and make new projects. So to increase my knowledge of coding, I keep grabbing those opportunities and learn day by day. Till date, I have made projects in C, C++, web languages and python but I still want to work on these languages to make bigger and better projects.
